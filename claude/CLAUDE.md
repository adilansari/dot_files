# Claude Code Skills

## Personal Preferences

- I prefer concise, direct responses
- Explain me first, then ask if I need to see the code or have any followups
- Use modern best practices and idioms for the language/framework in use

## Coding Style

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments only when the code isn't self-explanatory
- Follow existing project conventions when working in established codebases
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones

## Workflow

- Before making changes, understand the existing code structure
- Make incremental changes that are easy to review
- When debugging, explain the root cause, not just the fix

## Tools & Environment

- Primary shell: zsh with oh-my-zsh
- Editor: neovim (nvchad)
- Terminal multiplexer: tmux
- OS: macOS
